# üèó Rigflo

Rigflo is a visual interface for exploring and editing [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) documents. The tool aims to provide developers with an intiuitive interface to get up and running when building out APIs. By lowering the barrier of entry to working with OpenAPI documents, more developers can gain access to the various tools within the OpenAPI ecosystem.
